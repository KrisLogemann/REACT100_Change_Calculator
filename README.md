This is my third project in the react 100 curriculum of San Diego Code School. It is simply just a change calculator, you input the amount received, amount due, and hit calculate. You will see change due in twenties, tens, ones, quarters, dimes, nickels, and or pennies.

Thanks for checking out my code on GitHub.
